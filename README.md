Hi! I'm Liliia, and I'm really curious about how great products are created—from the first idea all the way to the finished product.

I enjoy creating things that make people's lives easier, smarter, or more enjoyable. I'm excited about all parts of product development—**coming up with ideas, talking to users, making prototypes, coding, analyzing data, and working with different teams**. I'm really interested in **product strategy, teamwork, user experience, marketing, and using data to make decisions**.

I work as a **Data Analyst / Data Science Specialist** using **Python, SQL, and Tableau** to solve business problems in **marketing, growth, and operations**. Most of my data-related work lives inside companies — but outside of work, I explore coding, tools, and product design on my own terms.

If you want to work together on something—I have LOTS of ideas to build—please reach out! (I don't have many coder friends, but I'd love to have some!)
