Hi! I am Lily, kind of geek ðŸ¤“ though I am a generalist, as I am interested in a wide range of fields and try to build skills in all of 'em
Well, welcome? 

PS actually T-specialist, i love data analytics

But currently I am trying to transition to PM role and building a side project (website where users can give a feedback or just leave positive words to another user, all feedback received will be displayed in user's wall)

Here is Figma Wireframe, I am currently struggling with Django part as this is unknown framework for me, but I will finish soon! :)
